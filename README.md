# Renesas-YRPBRL78L12-case
3d printable case for Renesas YRPBRL78L12 dev board.

# Description
The case fits perfectly when printed with 0.2mm layer height. To attach the top and bottom of the case together, I used M3 threaded brass inserts and M3 bolts.

The bottom part of case also has spacers that hold the board in place. It uses the space provided for rubber feet. Basically I am trying to say you need to remove the rubber feet, before putting the whole thing together.

In my board my potentiometer broke off, so I never created a hole for it. It should be quite simple change, if you want to use my model directly just break your potentiometer :-) (just kidding).
